"""
There is no specific function for cropping using OpenCV, 
NumPy array slicing is what does the job. 
Every image that is read in, gets stored in a 2D array (for each color channel). 
Simply specify the height and width (in pixels) of the area to be cropped. 
And itâ€™s done!

"""
Some Interesting Applications using Cropping
1. You can use cropping to extract a region of interest from an image and discard the other parts you do not need to use.
2. You can extract patches from an image to train a patch-based neural network.
